# GAN-Powered 2D-to-3D Model Generation System

A comprehensive AI/ML system for converting 2D images and sketches into detailed 3D models using Generative Adversarial Networks and TensorFlow. This project combines cutting-edge machine learning algorithms with an advanced web-based interface to democratize 3D model creation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system leverages deep learning techniques to solve the challenging problem of 2D-to-3D model conversion. By training Generative Adversarial Networks on large datasets of paired 2D images and 3D models, the system can intelligently infer depth, structure, and geometric properties to generate realistic 3D representations from flat images.

### Problem Statement
Traditional 3D modeling requires specialized skills and expensive software. This project aims to bridge that gap by allowing users to upload 2D sketches, photographs, or drawings and automatically generate corresponding 3D models suitable for 3D printing, game development, architectural visualization, and educational purposes.
